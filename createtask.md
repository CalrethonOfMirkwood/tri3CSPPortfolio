I made the card game war for my CB create task.  In this it is in the [`/createtask`](https://github.com/CalrethonOfMirkwood/tri3CSPPortfolio/tree/master/createtask) directory.

It uses pygame and as such cannot run on the replit.  However, below is a runtime video.  It describes in depth how the create task functions
