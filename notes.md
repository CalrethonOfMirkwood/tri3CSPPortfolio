- The digital divide, the technology access gap
- Technology is not accessible to everyone, exaggerated by digitization during lockdowns
- DNHS gives personal computers to students, even home wifi.  Has several computer labs and public computers scattered around the school.
  - Clearly very privileged, not much of a digital divide and the neighborhood as a whole is very well-to-do
- The global technology gap isn't unreasonable considering how resources have been historically distributed
  - Haves vs. have-nots, the "have" object is a computer
- Still some restrictions at school
  - Red tape (like in the computer lab), school blocks ~~literally any unmanaged site I swear the thing works on a whitelist~~ questionable sites (legally required)
  - Need personal computers in class because red tape policies require an administrator to manually approve and implement any changes to the school computers (ex. updating even a single python library)
- I'm annoyed by the policies and just avoid them by using a VPN, but I fully understand why the school would have such rules
  - If someone who couldn't think of using a VPN tried to access a school-blocked site, they should be paying attention in class

### Action
1. How does someone empower himself in a digital world?

To be empowered means that someone has the power and knowledge to be free and make their own choices.  People empower themselves in a digital world by learning about technology and using technology that they understand and can use to their own liking.  Most important is general understanding of computers, I would say knowing *what* a computer does and *how* and *why* it works is much less important than knowing how to code (although coding is very helpful with learning the previous three points).

2. How does someone empowered help someone who is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.

The school already provides plenty of resources to access technology such as internet access and personal computers.  What they do not give is _unrestricted_ internet access.  For this specific issue can teach people about ways to get unrestricted access like *hint* *hint* tor or a VPN.  Don't use VPNs if you don't know what they are or do, many VPNs log your data and are unsafe.  ProtonVPN is a safe and free option (the free US servers are blocked, use a Dutch server).

5. Is paper or red table blocking digital empowerment?  Are such barriers at Del Norte?  Elsewhere?

No, it is the opposite of digital empowerment, but sometimes empowerment comes behind safety especially if the person in question is a child.  There are barriers within the school's digital access, as described above, but they are only in the school and can largely be worked around.  Unfortunately, some countries have entire sites blocked by the government and are not digitally empowered.


# 5.1
- Technology can be both helpful and harmful depending on how it is used
  - Can technology made to be harmful?
    - Yes, obviously.  Think about sheer number of malware out there.
    - Intentionally addictive video games and social media platforms
- Helpful technologies automate tasks for people
- Telephone automation is an example of technology used for good
  - Used to need operators, now saves time and money for both caller and company
- "Technology" is such a vague term that literally anything as advanced or more advanced than carved rock is arguably technology
  - Rocks can be used to bash heads in, but they can also hunt/grind food to feed people
  - Are modern computers any different?  There's never been *major* major cyberwarfare but I think one is inevitable.
- More of a tool than something inherently good or evil
- But are tools good or evil?

### Action
1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing

Communication vs. Disinformation/social manipulation

Online socialization vs. irl isolation

Fun vs. Addictive

3. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?

Definitely a real thing, since corona I've been struggling with keeping focus/self-control as my time online increases.  It's getting harder and harder for me to focus on my homework, even assignments on paper, because the distractions are right in front of me.
